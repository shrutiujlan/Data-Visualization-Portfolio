# Outline

In this project I am to analyze and visualize New York City's restaurant inspection data to provide insights into food safety trends, geographical patterns, and the impact of inspections on the city's dining scene. By exploring the huge dataset, I'll uncover stories about neighborhood food safety, common violations, and how restaurants have adapted to health regulations over the years. The project will provide valuable information for NYC residents, tourists, restaurant owners, and policymakers, providing a data driven perspective on the state of food safety in one of the world's culinary capitals.

My analysis will focus on identifying trends in inspection scores, mapping food safety across different neighborhoods, examining the most common violations. I'll also represent how inspection results have changed over time, and also how they were impacted COVID-19 pandemic. Additionaly, to make it even useful for the audience, I'll represent a correlation between the restaurant ratings and price category with the restaurant inspection data. By presenting this information through interactive visualizations, I aim to make complex data accessible and engaging for the audience. 
 
# Project Structure

Setup: 
According to the 2024 Global Tastemakers, New York City is the best city in the nation for food and drink. It is a well-liked tourist attraction with a thriving restaurant scene that features cuisines from all over the world. As NYC serves millions of visitors and locals each day, maintaining food safety is essential to the general public's health as well as the city's standing as the food capital.

Conflict: 
Many restaurants find it difficult to continuously maintain food safety regulations, even with stringent inspection procedures in place. Violations can range from insignificant breaches to major health risks that could endanger diners. The complexity of running a restaurant in a fast-paced metropolitan environment, along with variable degrees of food safety education among workers, contributes to continual difficulty in maintaining high standards across the city.

Resolution:
We can spot patterns, point out areas that need work, and give diners and restaurant owners more authority by evaluating and visualizing data from restaurant inspections. This data-driven strategy can result in better training programs for restaurant employees, more focused interventions by health officials, and raised customer awareness of food safety in their favorite restaurants.

## Detailed Story Outline
### Setup:
Context of the Problem:
Begin by framing New York City as a global food capital, home to thousands of restaurants offering diverse cuisines to millions of residents and tourists. Given the scale of NYC’s restaurant industry, maintaining food safety is critical for public health. Introduce key statistics to illustrate the number of health inspections conducted annually and the percentage of restaurants that face food safety violations, setting the stage for the discussion of food safety challenges in the city.

Underlying Causes:
Explain the variety of factors contributing to food safety challenges, including the fast-paced nature of NYC’s dining scene, urban environment’s constraint, high staff turnover, and the different levels of food safety knowledge among restaurant workers.

### Conflict:

Impact of Food Safety Violations:
Highlight the fact that despite the extensive system, food safety violations are common, and the data reveals patterns of critical and non-critical violations. Briefly outline the consequences of food safety violations, like the potential health risks for consumers eg. foodborne illnesses, economic consequences for restaurants like fines, shutdowns, loss of reputation.

Complexities in Restaurant Operations: Delve into the complexities that restaurant owners face in consistently meeting food safety standards, from the demands of running a busy kitchen to ensuring that staff are adequately trained and knowledgeable about proper food handling and sanitation practices.

Pandemic-Related Complications: Delve into the complexities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, affected the restaurant inspection grading . Explore issues faced by restaurants like compliance with new regulations, staffing shortages, and operational shifts toward delivery and takeout presented new challenges.

### Resolution:
Adapting to Regulations: Many restaurants have improved their compliance with health regulations over time, leading to fewer critical violations. Insights from the data show how some neighborhoods are turning into safe zones

Public and Restaurant Owner Empowerment: By making this information more accessible to consumers and restaurant owners through visualizations and insights, the public can make informed dining choices, and restaurants can learn how to avoid violations.

Call to Action: Conclude with a strong call to action for restaurant owners, policymakers, diners, and public health officials to work together in addressing food safety challenges. Emphasize the application of data and visual storytelling may promote an environment of responsibility and result in significant improvements to the city's dining scene With increased awareness and actionable insights, NYC can continue to thrive as a culinary capital while ensuring public health and safety remain at the forefront.

# The data

I plan to use "DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection Results" dataset available on the NYC OpenData platform to create visualizations that illustrate food safety trends across the city, identify common violations, and analyze how inspection results vary by location, cuisine type, and time. The dataset's temporal aspect will allow us to examine how food safety has evolved over the years and how restaurants have responded to changing health regulations.
Based on the in-class critique, I was suggested to have a more comprehensive dataset so that I can create a story, I decided to use  "NYC Restaurants Ratings" from kaggle and yelp API get data on the restaurant ratings and price category.

| Name | URL | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection Results     |   https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j  | A comprehensive dataset which includes information on restaurant inspections conducted in New York City from 2014 to the present. It contains details such as restaurant names, locations, inspection dates, scores, violation codes, latitudes and descriptions, and grade cards issued.           |
|   NYC Restaurants Ratings |   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/beridzeg45/nyc-restaurants    | The dataset is a collection of 670 restaurants located in New York City and nearby areas. The dataset contains information on ratings, price categories, coordinates, and other relevant details. |
| Yelp API to get data for NYC Restaurant Ratings | https://docs.developer.yelp.com/reference/v3_business_search | Api to access NYC restaurant ratings | 


# Method and medium

I plan to use the following tools for my final Project:

- Tableau and Rawgraphs for Vizualizations
- Shorthand for final story narrative
- GitHub to host the portfolio
- Python to do data analysis
