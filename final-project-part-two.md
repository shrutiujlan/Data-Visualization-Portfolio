# Wireframes / storyboards

Shorthand for Storyboardingâ€‹


I worked on developing wireframes, and dashboards, and conducting user research to refine my storytelling concept.
The artifacts for this stage were created using Python and Tableau. 

# User research 

## Target audience

The primary audience for my story are:
Consumers/Diners: They can make informed dining choices based on inspection results and their correlations with restaurant ratings and price category
Restaurant Owners and Managers: They can use this data vitualization and analysis to improve their services by understanding the correlation between inspection grades and customer satisfaction

My data analysis can also be useful for Health Inspectors and Regulators who can get insights from the data can aid in policy-making and enforcement strategies.

The analysis shows how inspection grades relate to Google ratings, offering valuable information for improving restaurant quality and customer satisfaction. Additionally, understanding trends across different price categories can guide strategic decisions.
This approach ensures the project aligns with the needs of each audience segment, providing them with relevant insights to make better decisions.
