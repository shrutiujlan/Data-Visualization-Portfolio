# Wireframes / storyboards

Shorthand for Storyboardingâ€‹


I worked on developing wireframes, and dashboards, and conducting user research to refine my storytelling concept.
The artifacts for this stage were created using Python and Tableau. 

# User research 

## Target audience and Participant Demographics

The primary audience for my story are:
Consumers/Diners: They can make informed dining choices based on inspection results and their correlations with restaurant ratings and price category
Restaurant Owners and Managers: They can use this data vitualization and analysis to improve their services by understanding the correlation between inspection grades and customer satisfaction

My data analysis can also be useful for Health Inspectors and Regulators who can get insights from the data can aid in policy-making and enforcement strategies.

For the purpose of this user research, I picked three participants belonging to the same target audience particularly the audience. The participants were chosen on the basis of their demographics, dining frequency, and familiarity with data dashboards.

|------|------------------|
|   Background Questions      |       - How often do you eat out at restaurants? - What factors influence your choice of restaurant? - Are you aware of health inspection scores when choosing where to eat? - Do you prioritize price, quality, or safety when dining out?            |

|   Insights and Engagement   |         - What insights did you gain from the dashboard? - Did any particular visualization spark your curiosity or interest? - Is there anything you were left wondering about after exploring the dashboard?         |
|   Content, Presentation   and design |       - Does the order and flow of information make sense to you? - Are there any words or phrases that were difficult to understand? - Do the images and visualizations contribute to your understanding?    - Can you recognize a theme or color scheme? How effective is it?          |
|   Target Audience and Design   |       - Who do you think is the target audience for this dashboard? |
