# Wireframes / storyboards

I worked on developing wireframes, and dashboards, and conducting user research to refine my storytelling concept.
The artifacts for this stage were created using Python and Tableau. 

### Dashboard 1:

# User research 

## Target audience and Participant Demographics

The primary audience for my story are:
Consumers/Diners: They can make informed dining choices based on inspection results and their correlations with restaurant ratings and price category
Restaurant Owners and Managers: They can use this data vitualization and analysis to improve their services by understanding the correlation between inspection grades and customer satisfaction

My data analysis can also be useful for Health Inspectors and Regulators who can get insights from the data can aid in policy-making and enforcement strategies.

For the purpose of this user research, I picked three participants belonging to the same target audience particularly the audience. The participants were chosen on the basis of their demographics, dining frequency, and familiarity with data dashboards.

## Interview script


| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|   Background Questions      |       - How often do you eat out at restaurants? - What factors influence your choice of restaurant? - Are you aware of health inspection scores when choosing where to eat? - Do you prioritize price, quality, or safety when dining out?            |     
|  Clarity and Usability    |   -  Were you able to quickly understand each of the visualizations? - Did you find any part of the dashboard confusing or unclear?              |
|   Insights and Engagement   |         - What insights did you gain from the dashboard? - Did any particular visualization spark your curiosity or interest? - Is there anything you were left wondering about after exploring the dashboard?         |
|   Content, Presentation   and design |       - Does the order and flow of information make sense to you? - Are there any words or phrases that were difficult to understand? - Do the images and visualizations contribute to your understanding?    - Can you recognize a theme or color scheme? How effective is it?          |
|   Target Audience and Design   |       - Who do you think is the target audience for this dashboard? |
|   Suggestions and Improvements   |         - What changes would you suggest for this dashboard and why? - Is there any additional information or data you would like to see included?         |




## Interview findings

### Interviewee 1: Asian, Student, M(25) ,NYC
#### Key Insights:
- Most visualizations understandable and will be really useful for NYC consumers and restaurant/café managers.
- A simpler dashboards with fewer graphs will be easier to look it
- I concept of correlation was unclear, particularly in the first graph, which lacked a clear purpose.
- Suggested reordering legends for clarity and using a consistent color theme ( Red, Peach and Green) so that I won’t have to add multiple legends 
- Terms like "BORO" and "Correlation" were confusing.
- Didn’t understand the purpose of a chart in Dashboard 2 with the current storyline. 
- Try Highlight top 10 Cuisines for to avoid the cluttering of labels
#### Key Quotes: *“Legends should be placed in way its easier for the eyes to interpret graphs”*
*“I am new to the concept of correlation, maybe look a simpler way so that a wider audience can understand”*


### Interviewee 2: Asian, Working Professional, M(28) , NYC
#### Key Insights:
- The first dashboard was easy to understand and provided interesting insights. 
- However, the scatterplot in particular in the Dashboard  2 was difficult to understand in the flirst glance ; a box plot might be clearer.
- The "Inspection Grade by Cuisine and Boro" graphs  sparked their curiosity.
- Legends should be ordered correctly, and a consistent color theme is recommended. 
- The map and bar graph showing grades by boro both are representing the same data or idea; consider removing one.
- Provide context about the scoring system in Dashboard 2 with a brief explanation.
- Use catchy titles for scatterplots to highlight findings instead of just stating correlation values in the subtitle.
Ensure Dashboard 2 clearly indicates it's about NYC.
#### Key Quote: *“Give some context to the viewers in Dashboard 2 about the scoring system by writing a small paragraph”*

### Interviewee 3: : Asian, Working Professional, F(37), New Jersey
#### Key Insights:
- The first dashboard was easy to understand and provided interesting insights. 
- The alignment of the charts in the Dashboard 1 are not quite right
- The idea of myth busting dashboard is really good
- The title are great in Dashboard 1
- In Dashboard 2 , the story telling is missing, try to change the titles for the graphs so that they talk more about the story and not just show data
#### Key Quote: *“I’m not quite sure what correlation means here, you can probably define it on the dashboard”*
